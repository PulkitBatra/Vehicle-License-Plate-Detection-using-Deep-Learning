# Vehicle-Number-Plate-detection-Using-Tensorflow

## Categoty - Object detection & OCR
### We have to identify the license place in the image provided and do an OCR to extract the characters from the detected license plate.
#### The project developed using TensorFlow to detect the License Plate from a car and uses the Tesseract Engine to recognize the charactes from the detected plate.
* Dataset given in [**Indian_Number_plates.json file**](Indian_Number_plates.json)
